PYTHON - SNAKE GAME 

what you usually need for this game?:

- a window where you can play it (size)
- colors
- score
- gameloop (movement, defs, snake, food updating screen, set refresh rate)
- a snake (moving, speed, position, body, disappearing mechanism, appearing mechanism)
- the food ( position spawning mechanism, dissappering mechanism)
- game over (score, game over text) and the start menu (press a button..., logo, start text)





ingredients:

- Initialise the game window
- add colors
- fps controls
- set the  game variables (food and snake position, snake body, a Literal for the food spawn, direction)
- set the functions (quit, start, score)
- make the gameloop (movment, making sure the snake cannot move in the opposite direction instantaneously, food, border, snake hitting himself)


importable modules: time, sys, pygame, random 
good to search for: pop(), get_rect(), render(), blit() surface, insert(), rect(), tick(), update(), time.Cloack()


BONUS IDEAS:

- The rock. if you hit it you dies (EASY: change position if you it a food, MEDIUM: add more rocks,HARD: change the position in every 10sec ) 
- Red apple. if you eat it you will be faster EASY
- Green apple. if you eat it you will be slower EASY
- More score more speed MEDIUM
- No borders. whenever you go out from the screen you come back from the other side HARD
- if you want more, IT'S JUST UP FOR YOUR CREATIVITY
